# Text-Based-Adventure-Game
My submission for the CISP 360 Final Exam at FLC: a text-based adventure game written in C++. This program requires C++ 11 or later to compile and run.

  Enjoy this fun text-based console adventure game! You can explore dungeons, collect items, and encounter monsters, all while trying to find your way out of the dungeon. Safe travels, adventurer!
